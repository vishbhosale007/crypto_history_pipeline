This pipeline project aims to process and transform cryptocurrency trading data through three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each layer is responsible for specific tasks, including replication, consolidation, rectification, and aggregation of data. The data is stored in Delta tables, providing reliability, ACID transactions, and efficient querying.

Layers Overview
Bronze Layer
Objective: Replication of raw trading data.
Data Source: Local storage or external data streams.
Processing: Direct transfer of data into Delta tables.
Transformation: Minimal or no transformation applied at this stage.
Delta Tables: Raw trading data replicated from the source.
Example Process: Ingesting cryptocurrency trade data from various exchanges into Delta tables without significant alterations.
Silver Layer
Objective: Consolidation and rectification of trading data.
Data Source: Delta tables from the Bronze layer.
Processing: Aggregating, cleansing, and standardizing the data.
Transformation: Normalizing currency pairs, enriching data with additional information, handling missing values or outliers.
Delta Tables: Cleaned and standardized trading data.
Example Process: Consolidating trading data from different exchanges, converting timestamps to a consistent timezone, and rectifying discrepancies in data formats.
Gold Layer
Objective: Aggregation and summarization of trading data.
Data Source: Delta tables from the Silver layer.
Processing: Calculating metrics, aggregating data over specified time intervals.
Transformation: Computing aggregate statistics (e.g., average trade volume, maximum price) per currency pair.
Delta Tables: Aggregated summary data for analysis and reporting.
Example Process: Aggregating daily trading volumes and price movements per cryptocurrency pair for analytical purposes.
Pipeline Architecture
The pipeline is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy addition or modification of layers as per requirements. Apache Spark is utilized for distributed data processing, leveraging its parallel processing capabilities to handle large volumes of trading data efficiently. Delta Lake is used for storage, ensuring data reliability, transactional consistency, and compatibility with Spark's DataFrame API.

Technologies Used:
Apache Spark: Distributed data processing engine.
Delta Lake: Reliable data lake storage.
Python: Programming language for scripting pipeline workflows.
PySpark: Python API for Apache Spark.
GitHub Actions: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for automating pipeline execution and testing.
